            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: DEFEND beats ATTACK, so I get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn while opponent takes no damage. This is bad for me as I lose offensive capability next turn while opponent remains at 3 HP.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: KICKS beats DEFEND, but opponent chose ATTACK. Since ATTACK vs KICKS isn't directly specified in the rules, but KICKS beats DEFEND and DEFEND beats ATTACK, this suggests ATTACK likely beats KICKS. Opponent would deal 1 HP damage to me, reducing me to 2 HP while they stay at 3 HP. This is bad for me.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: KICKS\n- Outcome: FEINT beats KICKS, so opponent gets 'Cannot Kick' for 1 turn while taking no damage. Both players remain at 3 HP, but opponent loses kicking capability next turn. This gives me a strategic advantage by limiting their options without taking damage myself.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nFEINT",

However, if opponent expects me to DEFEND, they might KICK, making my KICKS a neutral trade.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: ATTACK beats FEINT, so I lose 1 HP (going to 2 HP) while opponent stays at 3 HP.
