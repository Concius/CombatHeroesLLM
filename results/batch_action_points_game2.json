My HP: 2, Opponent HP: 3, My AP: 0, Opponent AP: 0. This is a good outcome as it neutralizes the opponent's offensive capability for a turn, giving me time to potentially recover or plan an attack on my next turn (assuming I have more AP then).\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK (Opponent likely wants to capitalize on their HP advantage)\n- Outcome: I lose 1 HP. My HP: 1, Opponent HP: 3, My AP: 0, Opponent AP: 0. This is a bad outcome as it significantly reduces my HP and puts me at a greater disadvantage.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: KICKS (Opponent might anticipate a DEFEND and try to exploit it)\n- Outcome: I lose 1 HP. My HP: 1, Opponent HP: 3, My AP: 0, Opponent AP: 0. This is a bad outcome as it significantly reduces my HP and puts me at a greater disadvantage.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND\n",

            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: FEINT\n- Outcome: FEINT beats DEFEND in a neutral way (no direct damage), but opponent likely chooses FEINT to set up for next turn or because they can't afford ATTACK/KICKS. Both players remain at current HP (me: 3, opponent: 2), no debuffs applied. This maintains status quo but doesn't advance my position.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: ATTACK beats FEINT - I lose 1 HP, going from 3 to 2 HP. Opponent remains at 2 HP. This puts us at equal HP (2-2), which is bad for me since I'm giving up my HP advantage. This is a poor outcome.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: FEINT beats DEFEND in a neutral interaction (moves don't directly counter each other in the damage sense), but more importantly, if opponent chooses DEFEND, they're likely expecting my ATTACK next turn. Both players maintain current HP (me: 3, opponent: 2). This keeps my HP advantage while potentially setting up future tactical options.\n\nDEFEND",
