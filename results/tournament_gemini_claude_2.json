KICKS vs ATTACK results in no direct interaction in the rules, but looking at the rock-paper-scissors cycle, ATTACK would beat a FEINT, but against KICKS there's no clear winner stated. However, if they ATTACK and I KICKS, this likely cancels out or I need to check - actually, KICKS beats DEFEND, DEFEND beats ATTACK, so if they ATTACK, it doesn't directly interact with KICKS. Most likely this cancels out, keeping me alive at 1 HP and them at 3 HP.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nKICKS",
