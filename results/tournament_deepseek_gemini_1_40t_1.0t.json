            "p2_thoughts": "Here are three simulated universes to determine my best move:\n\nUniverse 1:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK. My opponent is at 2 HP and likely wants to finish the duel with an attack.\n- Outcome: My opponent gets 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. I remain at 1 HP, and they are at 2 HP. This is good because it limits their offensive capability for a turn, giving me a chance to plan.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND. My opponent may anticipate an attack since I'm low on HP and they have the advantage.\n- Outcome: I get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. I remain at 1 HP and they are at 2 HP. This is bad because I am now unable to attack, further limiting my options.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response: FEINT. Knowing I'm low HP and might be desperate, they might try to feint to bait me into a bad move.\n- Outcome: My opponent gets 'Cannot Kick' for 1 turn. I remain at 1 HP, and they are at 2 HP. This is slightly favorable as it limits their mobility.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND\n",
