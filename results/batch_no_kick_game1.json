            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: My attack is beaten by their defend. I get 'Cannot Attack' debuff for 1 turn. HP remains 3-3 but I'm debuffed, which is bad for me as it limits my options next turn.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: My defend beats their attack. They get 'Cannot Attack' debuff for 1 turn. HP remains 3-3 but opponent is debuffed, which is good for me as it limits their options and gives me tactical advantage.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: Their attack beats my feint. I lose 1 HP, going to 2 HP while opponent stays at 3 HP. This puts me at a significant disadvantage with lower health.\n\nDEFEND",
