For each, propose one of your available actions and then predict your opponent's *most likely* counter-move.\nEvaluate the outcome of this 2-move exchange.\n\nUniverse 1:\n- My Action: [ACTION 1]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: [ACTION 2]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: [ACTION 3]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\n---\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nBased on your 3 simulations, which *first action* is the best?\nOutput your single best action from the \"Available Actions\" list and nothing else.\n",
            "p2_thoughts": "Here are the three simulated universes:\n\nUniverse 1:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK. Given both of us are at 1 HP, the opponent is likely to try to directly attack to win.\n- Outcome: Opponent gets 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. My HP remains at 1, Opponent HP remains at 1. This is a good outcome for me because it prevents the opponent from immediately winning next turn and gives me a chance to attack.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND. The opponent is likely anticipating an attack, given we are both at 1 HP.\n- Outcome: I get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. My HP remains at 1, Opponent HP remains at 1. This is a bad outcome for me because I am now unable to attack next turn, and the opponent can attack me.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND. The opponent is likely to try to defend, as this is a common response.\n- Outcome: Opponent loses 1 HP. I win the game.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nKICKS\n",
