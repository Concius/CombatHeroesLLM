For each, propose one of your available actions and then predict your opponent's *most likely* counter-move.\nEvaluate the outcome of this 2-move exchange.\n\nUniverse 1:\n- My Action: [ACTION 1]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: [ACTION 2]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: [ACTION 3]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\n---\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nBased on your 3 simulations, which *first action* is the best?\nOutput your single best action from the \"Available Actions\" list and nothing else.\n",
            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: DEFEND beats ATTACK, so I get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. HP remains 3-2. This is bad because I lose my strongest offensive option next turn while opponent keeps all options available.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: DEFEND beats ATTACK, so opponent gets 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. HP remains 3-2. This is good because I neutralize their main threat and limit their options next turn while keeping my full arsenal.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: ATTACK beats FEINT, so I lose 1 HP. HP becomes 2-2. This is bad because it equalizes our health and gives opponent momentum, though they don't gain a debuff advantage.\n\n---\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND",
