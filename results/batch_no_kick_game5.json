This is a good outcome for me. Since I am already under the \"Cannot Attack\" debuff, defending against an attack effectively wastes the opponent's turn and doesn't worsen my own situation. It also sets me up to potentially attack on my *next* turn.\n\n**Universe 2:**\n\n*   My Action: DEFEND\n*   Opponent's Likely Response: FEINT\n*   Outcome: My HP: 3, Opponent HP: 3, My Status: Cannot Attack, Opponent Status: None. This is a neutral outcome. Both moves cancel out, and the game state remains unchanged. While not ideal, it's not harmful either.\n\n**Universe 3:**\n\n*   My Action: FEINT\n*   Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n*   Outcome: My HP: 2, Opponent HP: 3, My Status: Cannot Attack, Opponent Status: None. This is a bad outcome. If I feint and the opponent attacks, I lose a health point, putting me at a disadvantage.\n\n**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**\n\nBased on the simulations, DEFEND is the best action.

HP remains 3-3, but I'm debuffed. This is bad for me as it limits my options next turn.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: DEFEND beats ATTACK, so opponent gets 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. HP remains 3-3, but opponent is debuffed. This is good for me as it limits their options and gives me initiative.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: ATTACK beats FEINT, so I lose 1 HP. My HP becomes 2, opponent stays at 3. This is bad for me as I fall behind in HP with no compensation.\n\nDEFEND",
