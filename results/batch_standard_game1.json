If they attack, my feint loses and I take 1 HP damage. Given it's early game, opponent might try KICKS to counter potential DEFEND plays, making FEINT a reasonable risk with good upside if I read them correctly.\n\nFEINT",

The opponent receives 'Cannot Kick' for 1 turn. My HP: 2, Opponent HP: 3. This is a good outcome because it limits the opponent's options on their next turn.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND\n",
