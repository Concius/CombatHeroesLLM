Given they are ahead, a defensive maneuver to nullify my attack is strategically sound.\n- Outcome: I receive the \"Cannot Attack\" debuff for one turn, and the HP remains unchanged. My HP remains at 1, their HP remains at 3, and I have the \"Cannot Attack\" debuff. This is bad for me, as I waste my turn and become vulnerable.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK. They are likely to predict a defensive or tricky move and try to capitalize on it with a direct attack.\n- Outcome: Opponent's HP decreases by 1.
