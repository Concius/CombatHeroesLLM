My HP: 2, Opponent HP: 3. This is bad for me because I lose my offensive capability next turn, and the opponent is still in a better HP position.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK (They only have 1 AP and will likely use it to attack.)\n- Outcome: Opponent HP: 2, I remain normal. My HP: 2, Opponent HP: 2. This is good for me. We are now even HP and it gives me a greater chance to win the game.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nFEINT\n",

This creates a tied HP situation but I'm in a worse position having taken damage unnecessarily.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: KICKS (2 AP cost)\n- Outcome: KICKS beats DEFEND - I lose 1 HP, dropping to 2 HP. This ties the HP but puts me at a disadvantage. However, this is less likely than ATTACK since the opponent would probably prefer the guaranteed damage of ATTACK over KICKS.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND",
