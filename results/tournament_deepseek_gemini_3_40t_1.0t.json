Given my low HP, the opponent might play defensively to avoid taking damage, especially since a failed attack means I lose.\n- Outcome: DEFEND beats ATTACK. I get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn, and my opponent takes no damage. This is bad for me. My HP remains at 1, Opponent HP remains at 3, I get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn, and the opponent has no debuffs.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK.
