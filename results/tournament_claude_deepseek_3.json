Bad outcome since I lose tactical flexibility next turn.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: KICKS beats DEFEND, but opponent chose ATTACK. Since ATTACK doesn't directly counter KICKS in the rules, this would likely result in both actions connecting - I'd deal 1 damage to opponent (bringing them to 1 HP) while they deal 1 damage to me (bringing me to 1 HP). Risky but puts us both at critical health.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: KICKS\n- Outcome: FEINT beats KICKS, so opponent gets 'Cannot Kick' for 1 turn while taking no damage. Both players remain at 2 HP, but opponent loses access to KICKS next turn. This gives me tactical advantage by limiting their options without risking my HP.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nFEINT",
