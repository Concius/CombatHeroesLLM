My HP: 1, Opponent HP: 2, Opponent Status: Cannot Attack. This is a good outcome as it prevents the opponent from attacking next turn and gives me a chance to strategize.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND (They are at 2 HP and may anticipate an attack to try and negate it)\n- Outcome: My attack is defended, and I get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. My HP: 1, Opponent HP: 2, My Status: Cannot Attack. This is a bad outcome because I cannot attack on my next turn.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK (Since I'm at 1 HP, they'll likely try to finish me off)\n- Outcome: My opponent's attack hits me. My HP: 0, Opponent HP: 2. I lose. This is the worst possible outcome.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND\n",

            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: DEFEND beats ATTACK, so I get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. HP remains 2-1. This is bad because I get debuffed and don't reduce their HP to 0.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: ATTACK doesn't have a direct counter to KICKS in the rules, so KICKS would likely succeed. Wait, let me reconsider - KICKS beats DEFEND, but against ATTACK it's not specified. However, since opponent has 1 HP and is desperate, they might try ATTACK hoping for a favorable trade. KICKS vs ATTACK isn't clearly defined, but typically non-countering moves might cancel or have other effects. This is risky and unclear.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK beats FEINT, so I lose 1 HP, going from 2 HP to 1 HP. HP becomes 1-1. This is bad because it puts us at equal HP when I had an advantage.\n\nLet me reconsider Universe 2 more carefully:\n- My Action: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND (since KICKS beats DEFEND, they might avoid this) or FEINT (since FEINT beats KICKS)\n- Most likely they choose FEINT to counter KICKS\n- Outcome: FEINT beats KICKS, so I get 'Cannot Kick' for 1 turn. HP remains 2-1. This prevents me from using KICKS but doesn't change HP.\n\nActually, let me reconsider what beats what:\n- KICKS beats DEFEND (Defender loses 1 HP)\n- If opponent has 1 HP and I use KICKS, they're incentivized NOT to use DEFEND\n- They'd most likely use FEINT (which beats KICKS) or ATTACK\n\nUniverse 2 (revised):\n- My Action: KICKS  \n- Opponent's Likely Response: FEINT\n- Outcome: FEINT beats KICKS, I get 'Cannot Kick' debuff. HP stays 2-1. Not ideal but not terrible.\n\nThe opponent is at 1 HP, so they're desperate. They need to either survive or land a winning blow.\n\nKICKS",
