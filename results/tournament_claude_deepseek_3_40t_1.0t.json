Opponent loses 1 HP (down to 2 HP). I remain at 1 HP. This is good because I reduce their HP advantage while taking no damage.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: KICKS\n- Outcome: FEINT beats KICKS. Opponent gets 'Cannot Kick' for 1 turn. I remain at 1 HP, opponent at 3 HP. This is moderately good as I disable one of their options but don't reduce their HP.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND",
