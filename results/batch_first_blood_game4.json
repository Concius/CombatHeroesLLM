KICKS and ATTACK don't have a direct interaction in the rules, but looking at the rock-paper-scissors cycle: KICKS beats DEFEND, DEFEND beats ATTACK, ATTACK beats FEINT. The opponent would likely choose DEFEND to counter my KICKS, not ATTACK. Let me reconsider: if I use KICKS and opponent uses DEFEND, I win and they lose 1 HP (2-3 in my favor). If they use ATTACK instead, we don't have a direct counter-relationship, but ATTACK is strong. However, KICKS seems to be the most aggressive option that could give me an HP advantage.\n\nKICKS",
