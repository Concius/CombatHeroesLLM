For each, propose one of your available actions and then predict your opponent's *most likely* counter-move.\nEvaluate the outcome of this 2-move exchange.\n\nUniverse 1:\n- My Action: [ACTION 1]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: [ACTION 2]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: [ACTION 3]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\n---\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nBased on your 3 simulations, which *first action* is the best?\nOutput your single best action from the \"Available Actions\" list and nothing else.\n",
            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: My DEFEND beats their ATTACK. They get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. My HP remains 1, theirs remains 3. This is good because I survive and disable their primary offensive option next turn.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: My KICKS beats their DEFEND. They lose 1 HP (down to 2). My HP remains 1. This is good because I reduce their HP advantage while avoiding damage.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: KICKS\n- Outcome: My FEINT beats their KICKS. They get 'Cannot Kick' for 1 turn. My HP remains 1, theirs remains 3. This is moderately good as I disable one of their options, but doesn't reduce their HP advantage.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND",
