With a HP advantage they can afford to be aggressive.\n- Outcome: The attack is blocked, and the opponent gets the \"Cannot Attack\" debuff for 1 turn. My HP remains at 1, and the opponent's HP remains at 2. This outcome is neutral, preventing further HP loss.\n\n**Universe 3:**\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK.

My HP remains at 1, Opponent HP remains at 2. This is a decent outcome because it limits the opponent's options next turn and buys me time, but it doesn't directly improve my situation.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: I get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. My HP remains at 1, Opponent HP remains at 2. This is a bad outcome because I'm already at low HP and now I can't attack next turn.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response: FEINT\n- Outcome: Opponent gets 'Cannot Kick' for 1 turn. My HP remains at 1, Opponent HP remains at 2. This is a similar outcome to defending against an attack; it limits the opponent's options without directly improving my immediate situation. Given they have an HP advantage, limiting their offense could let them attack with less worry about my kicks being effective.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND\n",
