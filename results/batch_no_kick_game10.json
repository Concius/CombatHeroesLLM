            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: My attack is beaten by their defense. I get 'Cannot Attack' debuff for 1 turn. HP remains 3-2. This is bad because I lose offensive capability next turn and they maintain their defensive advantage.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: My defense beats their attack. They get 'Cannot Attack' debuff for 1 turn. HP remains 3-2. This is good because I neutralize their main threat and force them into a weakened position where they can only DEFEND or FEINT next turn.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: Their attack beats my feint. I lose 1 HP, making it 2-2. This is bad because it equalizes our HP and gives them momentum. With equal HP, the strategic advantage shifts toward whoever can land the next successful hit.\n\n---\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND",
