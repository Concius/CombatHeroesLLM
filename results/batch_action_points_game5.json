This is bad for me. I lose a health point, putting me at critical condition.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND (Opponent may anticipate my FEINT and try to conserve HP/AP)\n- Outcome: No change in HP or status for either player. This is a neutral outcome but leaves me with no AP.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND\n",

            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: FEINT\n- Outcome: FEINT beats DEFEND in a non-standard way, but looking at the rules, there's no direct interaction listed. However, since opponent has 1 AP and FEINT costs 1 AP, they can use it. Since DEFEND doesn't counter FEINT directly, this likely results in no damage to either player, but I waste my defensive positioning. Neutral outcome, both players end at same HP.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: Similar to Universe 1 but reversed roles. FEINT vs DEFEND isn't directly covered in the rock-paper-scissors rules provided, so this likely cancels out. However, FEINT is more aggressive positioning for future turns. Neutral immediate outcome but better strategic position.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: FEINT\n- Outcome: Identical moves cancel out according to the rules. Both players maintain current HP (me: 3, opponent: 2). This preserves my HP advantage while both players reset to 5 AP next turn, giving me more options while maintaining my lead.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nFEINT",
