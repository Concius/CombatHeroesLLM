This is bad because I lose my strongest offensive option next turn while opponent maintains flexibility.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: DEFEND beats ATTACK, so opponent gets 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. HP remains 3-2. This is good because I neutralize their main threat and force them into limited options next turn.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: ATTACK beats FEINT, so I lose 1 HP. HP becomes 2-2. This is bad because it equalizes the game when I currently have the HP advantage, and opponent maintains full action availability.\n\nDEFEND",
