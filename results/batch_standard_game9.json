This is bad because I lose offensive capability next turn and they maintain their HP advantage in positioning.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: FEINT\n- Outcome: My kicks beat their potential attack (they lose 1 HP, game ends 3-1 in my favor) but lose to feint (I get 'Cannot Kick' debuff). Since opponent is at 2 HP, they're likely to play more aggressively with ATTACK to try to damage me, making KICKS favorable.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: Their attack beats my feint, I lose 1 HP, making it 2-2.

My HP remains at 1, Opponent HP remains at 3. This is a good outcome because it neutralizes their offensive capability for a turn while preserving my limited health.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: Nothing happens, turn wasted. My HP remains at 1, Opponent HP remains at 3. This is a neutral outcome but suboptimal as I need to reduce their HP.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: I get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. My HP remains at 1, Opponent HP remains at 3. This is a bad outcome as I'm one hit away from losing and now I'm unable to attack next round.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND\n",

If they ATTACK and I KICKS, we need to check interactions - this isn't a direct counter relationship, so likely both actions execute. Opponent takes damage from KICKS, reducing them to 0 HP. This wins the game immediately.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: ATTACK beats FEINT, so I lose 1 HP, going from 3 to 2 HP. Opponent stays at 1 HP.
