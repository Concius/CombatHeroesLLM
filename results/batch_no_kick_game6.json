For each, propose one of your available actions and then predict your opponent's *most likely* counter-move.\nEvaluate the outcome of this 2-move exchange.\n\nUniverse 1:\n- My Action: [ACTION 1]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: [ACTION 2]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: [ACTION 3]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\n---\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nBased on your 3 simulations, which *first action* is the best?\nOutput your single best action from the \"Available Actions\" list and nothing else.\n",
            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: Both actions cancel out. HP remains 3-3, my \"Cannot Defend\" status continues. Neutral outcome - no progress made but no damage taken.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: ATTACK beats FEINT - I lose 1 HP (2-3). This is bad for me as I take damage and fall behind. My \"Cannot Defend\" status likely continues.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: DEFEND beats ATTACK - I take no HP damage but get \"Cannot Attack\" debuff for 1 turn. However, this removes my current \"Cannot Defend\" status and gives me access to DEFEND next turn, which could be strategically valuable.\n\n---\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nATTACK",
