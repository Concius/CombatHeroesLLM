            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: Both attacks cancel out. HP remains 3-3, I lose my \"Cannot Defend\" debuff. Neutral outcome - no damage dealt but I clear my debuff.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: Attack beats Feint - I lose 1 HP. My HP becomes 2, opponent stays at 3 HP. Bad outcome as I take damage and fall behind.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: Defend beats Attack - opponent takes no damage and I get \"Cannot Attack\" debuff for next turn. HP remains 3-3 but I'm debuffed. Poor outcome as I become limited in options.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nATTACK",
