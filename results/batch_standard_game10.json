This puts me at a tactical disadvantage while opponent maintains full HP and flexibility.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: FEINT\n- Outcome: If opponent chooses ATTACK, my kicks beat their attack and they lose 1 HP (opponent goes to 2 HP). If they choose FEINT, my kicks lose and I get 'Cannot Kick' for 1 turn. Since ATTACK is more aggressive early game, KICKS likely wins this exchange.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: Opponent's attack beats my feint, causing me to lose 1 HP (I go to 2 HP).

My opponent is now unable to attack, giving me a chance to take the offensive next turn or prepare for a different strategy.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: KICKS\n- Outcome: My feint is successful. My opponent receives the \"Cannot Kick\" debuff for 1 turn. My HP: 2, Opponent HP: 3, Opponent Status: Cannot Kick. This is a moderately good outcome. While it doesn't directly damage the opponent, it limits their options and forces them to react differently in the next turn. I still have to be cautious of a possible attack or defense.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND\n",
