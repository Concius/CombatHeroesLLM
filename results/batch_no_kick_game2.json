For each, propose one of your available actions and then predict your opponent's *most likely* counter-move.\nEvaluate the outcome of this 2-move exchange.\n\nUniverse 1:\n- My Action: [ACTION 1]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: [ACTION 2]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: [ACTION 3]\n- Opponent's Likely Response: [OPPONENT_ACTION]\n- Outcome: [Describe the resulting HP and debuff state and why it's good or bad for you]\n\n---\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nBased on your 3 simulations, which *first action* is the best?\nOutput your single best action from the \"Available Actions\" list and nothing else.\n",
            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: Opponent defends successfully, I get \"Cannot Attack\" debuff for 1 turn. HP remains 3-1, but I'm debuffed. This is bad because I lose offensive capability next turn while opponent maintains their position.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: DEFEND\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: I defend successfully, opponent gets \"Cannot Attack\" debuff for 1 turn. HP remains 3-1, but opponent is debuffed. This is good because it neutralizes their main threat and gives me control next turn.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: Opponent's attack beats my feint, I lose 1 HP. HP becomes 2-1. This is bad because I take damage and give up my HP advantage, making the game much closer.\n\nDEFEND",
