HP remains 3-3 but opponent is debuffed. This is good for me as it limits their options and gives me initiative.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: ATTACK beats FEINT, so I lose 1 HP. My HP becomes 2, opponent stays at 3. This is bad for me as I fall behind in HP with no compensation.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nDEFEND",
