However, since opponent likely expects me to attack for the win, they might attack themselves. If they attack and I kick, we both execute our moves independently. Need to check rules more carefully - this seems like both moves would resolve, so they'd hit me for 1 HP (making it 1-1) but my kick doesn't directly counter attack. This is risky.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response (Alternative): ATTACK\n- Outcome: If they kick, my feint beats their kicks and they get 'Cannot Kick' debuff while HP stays 2-1. If they attack, my feint loses and I take 1 HP damage (making it 1-1). Since they're at 1 HP, they're likely to be aggressive with ATTACK to try to equalize or win, making FEINT risky.\n\nWait, let me reconsider Universe 2:\n- My Action: KICKS  \n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: KICKS beats DEFEND - opponent loses 1 HP, going from 1 to 0. I win immediately! This is the best outcome.\n\nKICKS",
