Actually, opponent has all options available. ATTACK vs KICKS results in KICKS winning by the rock-paper-scissors dynamic - KICKS beats DEFEND, but ATTACK doesn't have a direct relationship with KICKS mentioned. Looking at the rules again: KICKS beats DEFEND, DEFEND beats ATTACK, ATTACK beats FEINT, FEINT beats KICKS. So ATTACK vs KICKS - there's no direct counter, so they likely cancel out. HP remains 2-2, no debuffs applied. This is neutral.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nKICKS",

            "p1_thoughts": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and simulate some possible futures.\n\n**Universe 1:**\n\n*   My Action: ATTACK\n*   Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND (Given their low HP, they will likely try to defend against an attack.)\n*   Outcome: My attack is defended, and I receive the \"Cannot Attack\" debuff for one turn. My HP: 2, Opponent HP: 1, My Status: Cannot Kick, Cannot Attack, Opponent Status: None. This is a bad outcome for me. I'm now vulnerable, and they are still at 1 HP.\n\n**Universe 2:**\n\n*   My Action: DEFEND\n*   Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK (They need to hit me to win, so attacking is a reasonable gamble.)\n*   Outcome: I successfully defend against their attack. My HP: 2, Opponent HP: 1, My Status: Cannot Kick, Opponent Status: Cannot Attack. This puts them in a very bad position, unable to attack next turn.\n\n**Universe 3:**\n\n*   My Action: FEINT\n*   Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK (With low HP, they might gamble on an attack to try and win outright. They know I cannot kick.)\n*   Outcome: My feint is countered by their attack. I lose 1 HP. My HP: 1, Opponent HP: 1, My Status: Cannot Kick, Opponent Status: None. This is a dangerous situation as the game is now tied in HP.\n\n**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**\n\nDEFEND\n",
