            "p2_thoughts": "Universe 1:\n- My Action: ATTACK\n- Opponent's Likely Response: DEFEND\n- Outcome: Opponent's DEFEND beats my ATTACK. I get 'Cannot Attack' for 1 turn. My HP remains 2, opponent HP remains 1. This is bad because I lose my primary offensive capability next turn while opponent remains at lethal HP.\n\nUniverse 2:\n- My Action: KICKS\n- Opponent's Likely Response: FEINT\n- Outcome: Opponent's FEINT beats my KICKS. I get 'Cannot Kick' for 1 turn. My HP remains 2, opponent HP remains 1. This is bad because I lose kicking capability while opponent faces no consequences.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: My FEINT beats opponent's ATTACK. Opponent loses 1 HP (goes to 0). I win the duel. This is the ideal outcome as it immediately ends the game in my favor.\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION:\nFEINT",
