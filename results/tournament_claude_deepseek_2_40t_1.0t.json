However, since ATTACK vs KICKS isn't defined as KICKS beating ATTACK, this would likely result in opponent taking 1 damage from my KICKS, reducing them to 1 HP. This puts significant pressure on opponent.\n\nUniverse 3:\n- My Action: FEINT\n- Opponent's Likely Response: ATTACK\n- Outcome: ATTACK beats FEINT, so I lose 1 HP and go down to 2 HP.
